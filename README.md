## 🎯 What We Do

**Not just AI news — who's connected to whom, what moves are being made, and what it means.**

We analyze the AI industry through the lens of:
- **Network topology** — Who knows who, and why it matters
- **Influence flows** — How decisions and ideas propagate
- **Talent migration** — Where the smart people are going
- **Capital movement** — Follow the money
